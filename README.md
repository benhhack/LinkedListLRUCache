# LRU Cache

I recently had an interview where I was asked to implement and LRU cache.
I worked my way towards an answer using an OrderedDict, however did not have time to complete the decorator.

This brief project implements and tests a linked list based LRU Cache and a decorator to wrap it around functions.


The project represents around 45 minutes of work (excluding writing this README and any pruning that may happen after this initial commit).

### Usage
Run the main file and see the decorator in action.

You can also copy the code and use the decorator on your own functions.


### Note
For the LeetCode question, the OrderedDict implementation is faster than the linked list ...
